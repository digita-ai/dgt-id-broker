This document provides a close comparison of classic OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Solid OIDC. We will demonstrate the differences between the classic OIDC flow and the Solid OIDC flow, as the latter requires some crucial additions to the former.


== Concepts


Resource Server (RS) :: A server hosting resources, possibly protected by access control policies.
      
Solid Pod :: A (virtual) root container on a Solid-compliant *Resource Server*.

Resource Owner :: An entity capable of granting other entities permissions (e.g. access rights) to protected resources.

End-User :: Originally meant as a synonym for human *Resource Owners*, here used to refer to the entity to which the permission is granted.

OAuth 2.0 :: An authorization framework enabling applications to obtain permissions for certain resources on behalf of an *End-User*.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) :: An authentication framework on top of the *OAuth 2.0* protocol, enabling applications to verify the identity of the *End-User*.

Authorization Server (AS) :: A system implementing the authoritative part of an _authorization_ framework (in casu *OAuth 2.0*).

Identity Provider (IdP) :: A system implementing the authoritative part of an _authentication_ framework (in casu *OpenID Connect*).

Client | Relying Party (RP) :: An application relying on an *Identity Provider* in order to access data or perform actions on behalf of the *End-User*.

Client ID :: An identifier used to register the *Client* with the *Identity Provider*.

Client secret :: A credential for the *Client* registered with the *Identity Provider*.

Redirect URI | Callback URL :: A URL to which the *Identity Provider* will redirect the user agent during the authentication flow.

Claim :: An authoratitive piece of information the *Identity Provider* can provide about the *End-User*.

Scope :: An indication of the *Claims* the *Client* would like the *Identity Provider* to provide.

Consent :: An affirmative action of the *Resource Owner* granting requested *Claims* to be provided to the *Client*. 

Grant Type :: The way in which the *Client* will authenticate itself when requesting the *Claims* from the *Identity Provider*.

Response Type :: The way in which the *Client* expects to receive the *Claims* from the *Identity Provider*. 

Authorization Code :: A secure *Response Type* in the form of a temporary code, which the *Client* can exchange for the *Claims*. 

Access Token :: A JSON Web Token (JWT) the *Client* obtains from an *Authorization Server*, containing *Claims* that grant permissions to access data or perform actions on a *Resource Server* on behalf of the *End-User*.

ID Token :: A JWT the *Client* obtains from an *Identity Provider*, containing *Claims* that prove the identity of the *End-User*.

WebID :: A *WebID* is an HTTP(S) URI which represents an Agent (Person, Organization, Group, Device, etc.) as defined in the link:https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/WebID/raw-file/tip/spec/identity-respec.html#introduction[WebID 1.0 specification].

PKCE :: Proof Key for Code Exchange, is a security extension to the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow for preventing code injection and man in the middle attacks, by linking the authorization request to the token request using a code.

Code Verifier ::  A cryptographically random string of 43 to 128 characters, which is generated by the *Client* in the *PKCE* process, and sent with the token request in order to verify the exchange.

Code Challenge ::  A transformation of the *Code Verifier*, often a base 64 encoding of a SHA256 hash thereof, used in the *PKCE* process, which is sent in the authorization request to be verified against later.

Code Challenge Method :: The method that was used to generate the *Code Challenge* from the *Code Verifier* _(e.g. SHA256)_.

DPoP :: Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession, is a security extension to OAuth 2.0, binding access and refresh tokens to a specific *Client* to prevent replay attacks. 

DPoP Header :: A JWT containing the *Client*s public key, as well as some request information (method and url) signed with the private key. Using the same key pair, one is generated for the *Token* request and one for the request to the *Resource Server*.

DPoP-Bound Token :: A sender-constrained *Token* issued by the *Authorization Server* by including a confirmation of the public key present in the *DPoP Header* (e.g. the JWK thumbprint).

Static Client Registration :: The manually registration of a *Client*, with its metadata (e.g. its *Redirect URI*), to an *Authorization Server*.

Dynamic Client Registration :: A mechanism that enables *Client*s to be registered (with their metadata) to the *Authorization Server* programmatically.

Registration Endpoint :: The optional API endpoint of the *Identity Provider* where a *Client* can request to be registered.

Authorization Endpoint :: The API endpoint of the *Identity Provider* where a registered *Client* can identify itself in order to get an *Authorization Code* for requesting a token. In classic OIDC, such identification consists of the *Client ID*, the *Redirect URI*, the *Scope* and the *Response Type*; in Solid OIDC, this is extended with the *PKCE* *Code Challenge* and *Code Challenge Method*.

Token Endpoint :: The API endpoint of the *Identity Provider* where an authorized *Client* can request tokens. In classic OIDC, such a request consists of the *Client ID*, the *Redirect URI*, the *Grant Type* and the *Authorization Code*; in Solid OIDC, this is extended with the *PKCE* *Code Verifier*, and must be accompanied with a *DPoP Header*.

WebID Verification :: Upon receiving a *WebID* as *Client ID*, the *Authorization Server* can retrieve it's profile as a third way of client registration. The *WebID* must contain a _solid:oidcRegistration_ triple containing the parameters required for registering. Upon verification these parameters are compared to the parameters provided in the authorization request. 


== Example


Throught this document, we will use the following example to illustrate the differences between the classic OIDC flow and the Solid-compliant one.

Imagine Alice wants to use a web service called Daily Pictures that will post a picture to her social feed every day on her behalf. Alice wants to give Daily Pictures consent to let it access the photo collection stored in her Solid Pod, and grant it permissions to create posts on her social feed.


== Classic OIDC 


Using classic OIDC, the following flow would suffice to give Daily Pictures access to Alice's pod, and in a similar way she could give it access to her social feed. This flow does, however, contain significant security issues, and is less interoperable within the fully compliant Solid ecosystem.

. Alice browses to the *Client's* (Daily Pictures) web page.

. She selects her choice of *Identity Provider*, like Google or Facebook, with which she should already have registered an account. The *Client* can either provide choices as a predefined list, or allow Alice to enter the *Identity Provider's* URI (e.g. `secureauth.org`).

. Now that it knows Alice's *Identity Provider*, the *Client* must retrieve its configuration, which describes everything the *Client* needs to know to identify Alice's. This configuration, if not stored in memory, can always be found at the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` path relative to the *Identity Provider's* URI, and will look somewhat like this: 
+
[source, json]

    "request_parameter_supported": true,
    "request_uri_parameter_supported": false,
    "require_request_uri_registration": false
}
----
+
In particular, notice the endpoint parameters: `registration_endpoint`, `authorization_endpoint` and `token_endpoint`, as well as the `jwks_uri`.

. Important in the classic OIDC flow is that the *Client* should be registered with the *Identity Provider* beforehand as well. This can either be a static registration, in the case of a select list of providers, or a dynamic one. For the latter, the *Client* can use the *Registration Endpoint* of the configuration to request it's registration. This enables the *Client* to register itself with any *Identity Provider* Alice may enter, even if it does not know it yet.

. The registered *Client*, can then redirect Alice's web browser to the *Authorization Endpoint* of the *Identity Provider*, which is an OIDC *Authorization Server*. This request contains the *Client ID*, *Redirect URI*, *Response type* and the *Scopes* that are needed. Among these there is a specific `openid` *Scope* that lets the *Authorization Server* know this will be a an OIDC exchange, and it will thus need to act like an *Identity Provider*. This request is made with the following parameters:
+
* *response_type* : The expected type of response data, `code` being the most secure (used in this example).
* *redirect_uri* : This is the URL where the *Identity Provider* will redirect to when Alice has successfully logged in.
* *scope* : The list of OIDC scopes
** *open_id* : is required to use the *Authoorization Server* as an *Identity Provider*, and get an *ID Token*.
** *offline_access* : is optional, to get a *Refresh Token*.
* *client_id* : the identifier with which the *Client* is registered at the *Identity Provider* through static or dynamic registration.
+
The request will then look like the following:
+
[source, json]
----
GET /authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdailypictures.example%2Fcallback&scope=openid%20profile%20offline_access&client_id=dailypictures HTTP/1.1
Host: secureauth.org
----
+

. The *Identity Provider* now takes over the user experience to verify Alice's identity, if necessary by prompting for a login. This can be done by a number of authentication methods, a password for instance. 

. The *Identity Provider* presents Alice with a *Consent* form that is based on the *Scopes* the *Client* requested. By accepting them, Alice can grant these permissions to the *Client*. In the example, she grants Daily Pictures access to the photo collection in her Solid Pod.

. When Alice has logged in, the *Identity Provider* will generate a cryptographic random string as *Authorization Code*, and stores it with the request parameters. It then redirects Alice back to the *Client's* *Redirect URI*, appending the *Authorization Code*: `https://dailypictures.example/callback?code=h-DnHRAfTsn9V_m4I1A3Cw`.

. The *Client* can now send a POST request to the *Token Endpoint* of the *Identity Provider*, with an URL-encoded body containing it's *Client ID*, *Client secret* and *Authorization code*, as well as the `authorization_code` *Grant Type*:
+
[source, json]
----
POST /token HTTP/1.1

---- 

. The *Identity Provider* verifies this data with the ones from the authorization request, and generates an *Access Token*, an *ID Token*, and optionally a *Refresh Token*.

.. *Access Tokens*, in classic OIDC, kan be either an opaque string (with no further meaning to the *Client*), or a JWT containing the following information.
+
* *"alg"*: the signing algorithm
* *"typ"*: indicates that this is a JSON Web Token
* *"iss"* : the URI of the *Identity Provider*
* *"sub"* : the issuer's identifier for the subject, Alice
* *"client_id"* : the *Client ID*
* *"scope"* : the list of *Scopes* requested in the authorization request
* *"aud"* : the token’s audience, e.g. the *Client ID* or the *Resource Server* indicated in the authorization request
* *"iat"*: the UNIX timestamp of when the token was issued
* *"exp"*: the UNIX timestamp of when the token will expire
* *"jti"*: a temporary unique identifier to prevent replay attacks
+
[source, json]

}
---- 

.. *ID Tokens* are generated because of the `openid` *Scope* in the authorization request, and are always JWT's containing the same information as the *Access Token* JWT, without the `client_id` and `scope` fields.

.. In case `offline_access` was added as a *Scope*, the *Identity Provider* will create a *Refresh Token*, which can be an opaque string or JWT with any identifier that allows the *Identity Provider* to retrieve the authorization information.

. If everything checks out the *Identity Provider* then adds these tokens to a JSON response to the *Client*, also repeating the expiration time and scopes of the *Access Token* (if not identical to the request), and the field `token_type` with value "Bearer":

}
----

. The *Client*, in our case Daily Pictures, can now use the *Access Token* directly as `Authorization: Bearer [...]` header to send requests to the *Resource Server*, in our case Alice's pod, in order to daily find a new picture for her social feed. Moreover, within the expiration time, the *Client* can use the *Refresh Token* to retreive a fresh *Access Token* to maintain it's access.

.A Classic OIDC flow
image::classic-oidc-flow.png[Classic OIDC flow]


== Solid OIDC


. Alice browses to the *Client's* (Daily Pictures) web page.

. In this Solid-compliant flow, there is another alternative option for Alice to indicate her *Identity Provider*: she can enter her own WebID (e.g. `alice.digital-id.net`), upon which the *Client* can request her WebID profile document to determine her *Identity Provider*. Such a document could look somewhat like this: 
+
[source, json]
----
@prefix : <#>.
@prefix solid: <http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#>.
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>.

<>
    a foaf:PersonalProfileDocument ;
    foaf:maker <https://alice.digital-id.net> ;
    foaf:primaryTopic <https://alice.digital-id.net> .

:me a foaf:Person ;
    a schema:Person ;
    foaf:name "Alice" ;
    solid:oidcIssuer <https://secureauth.org> ;
----
+
The URI of the *Identity Provider* is the value of the `solid:oidcIssuer` triple.

. Now that it has the URI of Alice's *Identity Provider*, the *Client* must retrieve its configuration, just like in the classic flow. To be solid-compliant, such a configuration should contain two extra parameters: `"solid_oidc_supported": "https://solidproject.org/TR/solid-oidc"`, indicating its compliance, and `"code_challenge_methods_supported"`, which should contain a list of accepted method for the *PKCE* extension.

. To be Solid-compliant, the *Client* must now use the secure link:url[PKCE, https://oauth.net/2/pkce/] enhancement to OIDC. To do so, it first needs to generate a *code verifier*. This can be a cryptographic random string (e.g. `LDKoTiFC6`). By encoding this code verifier with a *challenge method*  (e.g. `BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))`) we can create our *code challenge* (e.g. `92d5a871f52a513951e3260cd42b04f29b0f4a8bfea1740a0780e3db667`).

. After generating the *PKCE* parameters, an authorization request can be made to the *Authorization Endpoint*. This request looks the same as in the classic flow, with an extra `profile` *Scope* to request the *WebID* of the *End-User* (Alice), the extra *PKCE* parameters described above, and the possibility of a URI as *Client ID*:
+
[source, json]
----
GET https://secureauth.example/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdailypictures.example%2Fcallback&scope=openid%20profile%20offline_access&client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fdailypictures.example%2Fwebid%23this&code_challenge_method=S256&code_challenge=92d5a871f52a513951e3260cd42b04f29b0f4a8bfea1740a0780e3db667
----
+

. Note that in this flow, it is not necessary for the *Client* to be registered beforehand with the *Identity Provider*. Instead, the *Client* can use a URL as its *Client ID* that dereferences to a JSON-LD serialized RDF document with its registration parameters. For example: 
+
[source, json]
----
{
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/oidc-context.jsonld",

    "client_id" : "http://localhost:3002/clientapp/profile",
    "redirect_uris" : ["http://localhost:3001/requests.html"],
    "client_name" : "My Demo Application", 
    "client_uri" : "https://app.example/",
    "logo_uri" : "https://app.example/logo.png",
    "tos_uri" : "https://app.example/tos.html",
    "scope" : "openid offline_access",
    "grant_types" : ["refresh_token","authorization_code"],
    "response_types" : ["code"],
    "default_max_age" : 60000,
    "require_auth_time" : true
}
----
+
If the Solid-compliant *Identity Provider* receives a request with such a *Client ID*, it should always check the request parameters with the ones in that document.
+
Alternatively, the *Client* can present itself as an ephemeral, anonymous public client by using the *Client ID* `http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#PublicOidcClient`. In such cases, the Solid-compliant *Identity Provider* must accept the request, taking any *Redirect URI* to be valid.

. Finally Alice is prompted to login by the *Identity Provider*. This happens identical to the classic flow, with the remark that the stored request parameters now also contain the *PKCE* parameters.

. After logging in the *Identity Provider* generates an *Authorization Code* and sends it back to the *Redirect URI*.

. The *Client* must now generate a *DPoP Token*. The *DPoP* enhancement of the flow proves to the resource server that the *Client* it is the same application that got the token from the *Identity Provider*.

.. The first step to achieve this is is for the *Client* to generate both a pair of private and public keys. A private key could look like this (and a public key is the same with some fields left out):
+
[source, json]
----
{
    "kty": "EC",
    "kid": "2i00gHnREsMhD5WqsABPSaqEjLC5MS-E98ykd-qtF1I",
    "use": "sig",
    "alg": "EC",

    "d": "RrM4Ou_7PzjP24B4k06B9ZML16HbfzNPKFN11Z8c9_s"
}
----

.. Next we need to generate our *DPoP Token*. We can achieve this by creating a *JSON Web Token* and singing it with the private key we just generated. The header of this JWT contains the public key, as well as the signing algorithm and the `dpop+jwt` type:
+
[source, json]
----
{
    "alg": "ES256",
    "typ": "dpop+jwt",
    "jwk": {
        "kty": "EC",
        "kid": "2i00gHnREsMhD5WqsABPSaqEjLC5MS-E98ykd-qtF1I",

        "y": "ay9qDOrFGdGe_3hAivW5HnqHYdnYUkXJJevHOBU4z5s"
    }
}
----
+
The body of the JWT contains the following parameters.
+
* *"htu"*: The URL at which the token can be used.
* *"htm"*: The method with which the token can be used.
* *"jti"*: A unique identifier to prevent replay attacks.
* *"iat"*: The UNIX timestamp of when the token was issued.
+
[source, json]
----
{
    "htu": "https://secureauth.example/token",
    "htm": "POST",
    "jti": "4ba3e9ef-e98d-4644-9878-7160fa7d3eb8",
    "iat": 1603306128
}
----

. Finally the *Client* can perform a token request to the *Token Endpoint* of the *Identity Provider*. Additionally to the classic flow, it inludes the *PKCE* *Code Verifier* in the body and the *DPoP Token* in the *DPoP* header:
+

---- 

. Just like in the classic flow, the *Identity Provider* will now compare the data with the ones from the authorization request. 

. Additionally, the *Identity Provider* will encode the *PKCE* *Code Verifier* of the token request with the *Code Challenge Method* of the authorization request, and check if the result is identical to the *Code Challenge* it also received in the authorization request.

. Also, the *Identity Provider* will get the *Client's* public key from the header of the *DPoP Token*, and check if the token contains a valid signature.

. If everything checks out, the *Identity Provider* will then generate an *Access Token*, an *ID Token* and optionally a *Refresh Token*. To be Solid-compliant, the *Access Token* additionally needs to include a `webid` claim with the WebID of the *End-User* (because of the `profile` *Scope*), and an `aud` claim containing "Solid" (the audience of the token).

.. Because of the `profile` *Scope* required in this flow, the *Access Token* now also contains a `webid` field with the *WebID* of the *End-User*, in addition to the information of the classic flow. Moreover, to be Solid-compliant, the`aud` claim should contain the "solid" audience. To bind the *Access Token* to the *Client*, the *Identity Provider* includes the thumbprint of *Clients* public key (e.g. `9XmwK8mQ3H5-PnzAt3lFHzWBW_v5QhYynezbbit4kC8`), typically as `jtk` field under the `cnf` (confirmation) object, and signs it using its own keys. When decoded it will look somewhat like this:

---- 

.. The *ID Token* is almost identical to that of the classic flow, with the addition of the `webid` claim, and the remark that because of the extra client registration possibilities, the *Client ID* in the `aud` claim can now be a URL. 

.. In the *Refresh Token*, nothing is different from the classic flow.

. Just like in the classic flow, if everything checks out the *Identity Provider* will send a response that contains all generated tokens in the body. The `token_type`, however, will indicate "DPoP".

. The *Client* can now use the *Access Token* in `Authorization: DPoP [...]` header of requests to Alice's pod. To be valid, however, these requests will also have to contain a `DPoP` header with a *DPoP* token generated with the same keys as the token request to the *Identity Provider*, but now for the method and URL of this request to the *Resource Server*.

== Summary


Solid-OIDC spec is basically OIDC Discovery, followed by the OIDC Authorization Code Flow with the OAuth2.0 PKCE extension, using a DPoP-bound access token, and making TLS mandatory for communication and WebIDs mandatory as identifiers. Concretely, Solid OIDC adds the following requirements to classic OIDC. 

Users ::

* Should provide a WebID that dereferences to a valid WebID profile document. 

Clients ::

* May use a URL as their Client ID, which must dereference to a JSON-LD serialized RDF document with OIDC client registration parameters.
* May use the ephemeral client identifier `http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#PublicOidcClient`.
* Must provide PKCE parameters in the authorization and token requests.
* Must provide a DPoP token in the token request and the requests to the Resource Server.

Identity Providers ::

* Must advertise its compliance in the OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 resource, with `"solid_oidc_supported": "https://solidproject.org/TR/solid-oidc"`.
* Must dereference the Client ID, if it is a URL, and match any client-supplied request parameters. 
* Must accept requests of ephemeral clients, with any Redirect URI.
* Must provide a DPoP-bound Access Token to the client, containing the WebID of the End-User, and "solid" as an audience.
* Must provide an ID token containing the WebID of the End-User.

Resource Servers ::

* Must inform the Client that a DPoP-bound Access Token is required upon request of a non-public resource.
* Must dereference the WebID in the Access Token and check it against the `iss` claim in the Access Token.
* Must get the public key from the Identity Provider, and use it to validate the signature on the DPoP-bound Access Token.
